## Summary

At Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of aviation safety, security, and operational efficiency. In alignment with 14 CFR § 139.337 and DTW’s Wildlife Hazard Management Plan, we recognize that proactive identification and mitigation of wildlife hazards are essential to reducing strike risks and protecting both airfield operations and the traveling public. Coyotes (_Canis latrans_) have emerged as a persistent and adaptable hazard at DTW, capable of breaching perimeter defenses and posing threats to safety, security, and airfield operations. Recognizing the importance of this issue, we (the Wayne County Airport Authority’s Airfield Operations – Wildlife Division) conducted a systematic evaluation of coyote activity, management, and exclusion effectiveness. We applied a comprehensive suite of methods, including relative hazard ranking, strike metric evaluation, integrated data analysis, dig and postmortem surveys, site inspections, camera trapping, and spatial analysis. Our findings identified coyotes as a highly hazardous species at DTW, revealed key perimeter vulnerabilities, and highlighted opportunities to better allocate resources for more effective exclusion. Our results also challenged existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gap-size standards for coyote exclusion and enabled us to develop empirically informed recommendations to improve exclusion practices. Through this work, we established essential baseline metrics and supported the development of centralized databases to inform ongoing and future assessments at DTW. Collectively, these efforts advance our commitment to science-driven, adaptive wildlife hazard management to maintain safe and efficient airfield operations.
